I honestly can't tell you how many times I had trouble following the textbook.
Nodejs installed on this vm was version 4.2.6 and couldn't run the code from
textbook without error message stating that the version is known to break npm.
Uninstalling and reinstalling nodejs multiple times.  Installing through nvm
manager.  Eventually I got it to work, but so many frustrating hours were spent
trying to detect the problem and solving it.  I even installed a new vm with Ubuntu
instead of the Xubuntu vm I'm currently using.  It didn't work on the Ubuntu vm,
so I gave that up.  I spent more hours trying to fix it so it would work on
Xubuntu vm.  So painful and stressful this assignment was.  (sadness)
